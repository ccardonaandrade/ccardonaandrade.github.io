::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome to my website! Hi, I am an economist with over 5 years of experience in applying advanced statistical techniques, econometrics, and data analysis to address challenges in political economy, trade, and regional integration. My expertise spans large-scale data analysis, machine learning, and the visualization of high-dimensional data, with a focus on social sciences and economic development, particularly in Africa. I have a strong background in teaching and research, having worked with institutions like the University of Warwick, Universidad del Rosario, and The World Bank.
