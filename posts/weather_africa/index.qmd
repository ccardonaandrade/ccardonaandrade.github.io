# Introduction

<center>![Source: The map at the left uses the [Climatic Research Uni](https://warwick.ac.uk/) data from the University of East Anglia while the one at the right uses [University of Delaware](http://climate.geog.udel.edu/~climate/html_pages/download.html) data](img/africa_comparison.gif){fig-align="center" width="380"}</center>

This is a project aiming to collect weather datasets for Africa that are most widely used by development economist, to analyze their distinctive predictive power for agricultural output and conflict, and to give a recommendation about when and how to improve their use. I will update the current state of the project soon.
