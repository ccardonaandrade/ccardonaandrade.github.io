# Introduction

<center>![Source: The maps use data from the [Climatic Research Unit](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/?_ga=2.155919481.358173271.1680901909-295362121.1680450841) and the [University of Delaware](http://climate.geog.udel.edu/~climate/html_pages/download.html) respectively.](img/africa_comparison.gif){fig-align="center" width="420"}</center>

This is a project aiming to collect weather datasets for Africa that are most widely used by development economist, to analyze their distinctive predictive power for agricultural output and conflict, and to give a recommendation about when and how to improve their use. I will update the current state of the project soon.
